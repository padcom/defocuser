### It's easy!

```
npm install --save-dev defocuser
```

or

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/defocuser"></script>
```

and then use it on the element you want to track outside clicks of:

```
<div id="my-dropdown">....</div>

const defocuser = new Defocuser()
const el = document.querySelector('#my-dropdown')
defocuser.addElement(el, 'bubbling', () => console.log('Clicked outside of #my-div'))
```
